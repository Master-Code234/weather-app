# weather app

## Approach taken:

To create this weather app, I followed these steps:

- UI Design: I started by breaking down the user interface (UI) into components and designing a layout that ensures an excellent user experience.

- Component Development: With the design in place, I proceeded to develop the various components of the app. These components are responsible for displaying weather-related information on the screen. Initially, I used test data to visualize the UI and ensure the components were rendering correctly.

- API Integration: The next crucial step was to integrate the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve real weather data for user-specified locations. This involved making API requests to fetch weather information, including temperature, conditions, and more.

- User Interaction: Users can enter a location of their choice to fetch weather data for that specific area. The app is designed to handle user input and provide the relevant weather details.

The Weather App is a work in progress, and further enhancements and features are planned for future updates.

- Make sure to CD into the project file
- run npm i
- Get an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/)
- Start the development server with npm run dev.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement a geoLocator API to automatically determine the user's location.
- Enhance the search bar with a list of searchable locations for user convenience.
- Expand the app to display additional weather information, such as a 7-day forecast.

## Known Issues:
- The app does not currently display an error message for a location not found.
